# This is a simple C++ system for the hostel management to manage hostel application applied by the students every year. 
<p align="justify">
It allows students' information to be stored and access easily by officer in charge. Only students who have exceeded the minimum score points will be offered to stay in the Hostel for the next academic year. Due to the number of hostel’s room is not sufficient for all the student, it has introduced accumulated points system called continuous student development (MyCSD). Each student should collect points within academic year in order to qualify them to apply hostel for next academic year. The points can be collected by joining the activities organized by school and hostel. It also allows student to display their score points and their status (qualified or not qualified to apply hostel). Thus, it will encourage them to join more activities. Therefore, as a programmer, you are required to develop an application called “1-Hostel”, to help the hostel management team to store and to manage students’ information by utilizing array. Your 1-Hostel system must be able to perform some basic operations such as Add new student’s information, Display and Search.
